We are finally ready to reveal our first product: a chemistry set that you can use at home! However, this is not a traditional chemistry set. We’ve identified the three main problems we see in existing chemistry sets and have fixed them in our new, innovative offering. You can also sign up to be notified when the product is released.

## Why chemistry?

Chemistry is one of the most important science. Everything around us is made frome chemical substances. Chemistry is inside every living cell as well as inside computers, automobiles and clothes.

And chemistry is fun. Chemistry is visual. You can touch it, see it, and smell it. There is a lot of cool science based on chemistry. If you dig deeper into this exciting world, it could be a great introduction to many other topics, including quantum physics, optics, thermodynamics, and many more. In other words, chemistry is a perfect place for children to start their lifelong journey with science.

## Three problems with existing chemistry sets

We all want to find a product that will be interesting for children and also explain science in a clear, enjoyable way. Unfortunately, existing chemistry sets have three main problems:

1.	You buy the set in a store, use it once, and then store it on a shelf for the next decade
2.	They are basically toys: the “experiments” are fun, but fail to teach much. Children are not guided well to understand the science behind the experiments
3.	The sets are “old-school”: they are not interactive, there is no way to check your progress or retention, and they are not motivating or particularly engaging

## What we are doing instead!

What we offer is not a “big box,” but a subscription service! By subscribing to MEL Chemistry, you will receive a new chemistry set every week by mail. Each weekly chemistry set contains 1-3 interesting experiments that your children can do on the weekends. A typical weekly box will look something like this:

I don’t know about you, but we’re quite concerned about the educational progress of our children. They often spend more time playing computer games than studying science and math, so we are trying to do everything we can to make science as interesting and appealing as possible.

Many people are afraid of chemistry, particularly what certain reactions can cause, but we have ensured that our experiments are extremely safe. There will be no explosions or harmful substances of any kind as a result of our experiments. We initially thought that such a careful approach would limit us, but in fact, we have developed and designed hundreds of unique and exciting experiments that are completely safe for our users.

However, we don’t just create interesting experiments; we also make sure that you thoroughly understand what happens in each experiment. We reveal how nature is structured from the inside out, opening up a world of curiosity and wonderment for your child.

Your child will not only be receiving a chemistry set. We are also developing a mobile app showing structural formulas and 3D models of molecules that effectively explains how reactions occur on a visual and accessible scale. What we do is essentially provide you with a virtual microscope that lets you use your smartphone or tablet to look inside physical matter and understand another fascinating side to the world around us. In my opinion, this is the most important part of our system; it provides a way to understand the real science behind the chemical tricks.

## Price

Each weekly experimental set only costs $10. This price includes shipping.

## How do I subscribe?

MEL Chemistry is not ready just yet. However, it will be ready very soon. You can send in a preorder request and we will contact you as soon as our first set is ready to be released!

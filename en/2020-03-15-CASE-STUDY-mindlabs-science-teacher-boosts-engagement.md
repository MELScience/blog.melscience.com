<h3>Using MEL Chemistry kits in class</h3>
 
Using MEL Science has increased engagement in my science classroom. As a TK-8 Science Teacher, I am not only constantly looking for ways to engage my students in chemistry but also to allow them to participate in planning for their own learning.

<sub>Jenn’s students were amazed at the reactions they were able to achieve.</sub>

<blockquote>““I love that the kits allow them to operate fairly independently of each other and me when they are learning, which causes them to take more ownership of the process.”
”</blockquote>

The MEL Chemistry kits I have purchased for my Chemistry Club allow students to decide what topic they would like to address and I can provide them with additional videos and resources to go along with each project.

<sub>“They love following along with the app and the instruction cards, and enjoy that everything is already pre-set out for them but still requires precise measuring.”
</sub>

They also love the troubleshooting sections as it allows them to discover the answers independently of me and try different things when they don't succeed the first time. 

Lastly, we LOVE the catchy names, visuals, and videos that come along with each kit! Thanks for making learning chemistry so much fun!’

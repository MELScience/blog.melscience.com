A couple of weeks ago, the residents of Tasmania — the island off the Australia’s southern coast — witnessed an amazingly rare phenomenon. The water in the River Derwent turned brilliant blue. This happened because of the presence of millions of dinoflagellates – bioluminescent plankton that glows when disturbed. This article will explain you what bioluminescence is and how living organisms, including dinoflagellates, use it.

##What is bioluminescence?

Besides single-celled dinoflagellates, bioluminescence is widespread among animals, especially the deep-sea habitants, such as anglerfish and dragonfish. The range of colors produced by bioluminescence is also wide: from blue in dinoflagellates and green in fireflies to red in loose-jawed fish and yellow in genus Tomopteris.

The most common type of bioluminescence is based on a conversion of a compound called luciferin to oxyluciferin in the oxidation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme luciferase. The energy generated in this process is released in the form of light and the simplified reaction is the following:

The presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is essential for luciferase to work, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecule is needed for the oxidation to take place — both inside or outside the cells.

This, however, is not the only mechanism. Some jellyfish and worms use another protein called aequorin instead of luciferase. Dinoflagellates are even more mysterious: the mechanism of their bioluminescence has been shown to involve the proteins called proton channels that get opened when stimulated by chemical or electrical stimuli, thus activating luciferase and producing light.

##The History of Bioluminescence 

In ancient times, before the safety lamps were invented, coal miners used bottles with fireflies as a weak source of illumination while working underground. The use of fireflies instead of candles helped to prevent the detonation of firedamp, which was the main cause of miners’ deaths at that time.

A French pharmacologist Raphael Dubois was the first person to refuse the idea (widespread at that time) that bioluminescence came from phosphorus and, instead, suggested that it was based on the oxidation of luciferin. The first serious work on bioluminescence was the “Nature of Animal Light” by E. Newton Harvey published in 1920 which summarized all the information known about bioluminescence at that time. A japanese scientist Osamu Shimomura, who together with Martin Chalfie and Roger Y. Tsien won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008 for the discovery of green fluorescent protein, was the first person to obtain the crystalline luciferin.

##Application in wildlife

Bioluminescence has many applications in wildlife: in defense, attraction, communication, and warning. For example, some squids that live in the deep sea break off their luminous arms that continue to flash to distract the predator. Fireflies use bioluminescence to draw mates, while some marine snails – to scare off predators, as do dinoflagellates. Here you can watch the video concerning top 10 bioluminescent organisms:

##Conclusions

Bioluminescence is a very fascinating phenomenon. Living organisms use bioluminescent light for many different purposes. And while the <a href="http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/science-environment/2015/05/bioluminescence-sea-sparkles-in-tasmania/1">Tassie waters turning blue </a> were undoubtedly cool, finding the application for bioluminescence to solve some of the problems that humanity faces would be even cooler. That’s why scientist and engineers try to find its use in experimental cancer treatment and even in the newly designed bacteria-containing lamps that may someday reduce the need for street lighting.

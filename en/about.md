# About MEL Science

Do you want your children to love science and access the most advanced and exciting knowledge as they develop?

We have created a chemistry experimental set for children that allows safe experiments to be conducted at home. This is not like chemistry sets that you buy in a store, use once, and then store on a shelf for the next decade. Our chemistry set will be delivered to your home over time, in a subscription style, essentially introducing you to 1-3 experiments per week.

Our chemistry sets, which have been designed and created by experienced chemists, will captivate the interest of your child. The experiments demonstrate real science in all of its depth and beauty, engaging that excitement in your growing child. We will also provide you with scientific support if an experiment does not work properly or if you have any questions about the experiments we’re designed.

Along with the chemistry set, you will receive an educational app for your smartphone or tablet that shows you how substances behave in reactions using 3D models. This innovative app will also let you find out more about the main topic of the experiment and answer questions relating to that area of knowledge.

MEL Chemistry is the first chemistry set that actually teaches you chemistry rather than simply showing you tricks with a scientific slant.

## How it all began
Quite simply, we came together because we’re science nerds. Almost everyone on our small team became seriously addicted to some form of science during their childhood. Some got hooked on chemistry, while others are passionate about mathematics and physics. If you add up our members’ results from scientific Olympiads, it would look a bit like this:

* twice took first diploma in city Olympiads in chemistry and four times took diplomas at national competitions in chemistry,
* twice took first diploma in city Olympiads in physics and once at the All-Russian Olympiad in physics,
* in mathematics, we took second place,
* as well as first diploma in the country in programming.

Following our early competitive academic careers, we moved on to different things. Some of us remained in science and founded the most popular scientific tournament in Russia. Others have developed video games, such as FIFA Street and FIFA 12, recreated the first manned flight into space using 3D models and founded a 3D design studio, and founded two mobile software development companies, both of which have a staff of over one hundred people.

When some of us started our families and had children, we realized that the existing level of education was unacceptable. We wanted to give our children more. Given that vision, here we are, joined together by the common goal of making the transference of scientific knowledge easier, more interesting, and more effective.

## What we are doing

By subscribing to MEL Chemistry, you will receive a new chemistry set every week by post. Each weekly chemistry set contains 1-3 interesting experiments that your children can do on the weekend. I don't know about you, but we are personally concerned about the educational progress of our children. They often spend more time on computer games than science and math, so we are trying to do everything we can to make science as interesting and appealing as possible.

Many people are afraid of chemistry, particularly what certain reactions can cause, but we have done everything possible to make our experiments extremely safe. There will be no explosions and no harmful substances of any kind. We initially thought that this overly careful approach would limit us too much, but in fact, we have found and designed hundreds of really cool experiments that are completely safe.

However, we don't just create interesting experiments; we also make sure that you thoroughly understand what happens in each experiment. We reveal how nature is structured from the inside out, opening up a world of curiosity and wonderment for your child.

You can see the difference in our approach immediately. For example, here’s a neat experiment involving the combustion of hydrogen bubbles:

<br>

It's a cool experiment, right? Yes. Will your children learn anything from it? No.

However, if you combine this pretty experiment with a demonstration of what is physically happening inside, on a molecular level, then the depth of understanding will be completely different – and much richer!

Your child will not only be receiving a chemistry set. We are also developing a mobile app that shows the structural formula and 3D models of molecules and effectively explains how the reaction occurs on a visual and accessible scale. Thus, software development is just as important to us as chemistry set manufacturing. What we do is essentially provide you with a virtual microscope that lets you use your smartphone or tablet to look inside physical matter and understand another fascinating side to the world all around us.

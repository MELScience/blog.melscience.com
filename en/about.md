# About MEL Science

Do you want your children to love science and gain the most advanced knowledge?

We create a chemistry experimental set for children that allow you to conduct safe experiments at home. Not a type of chemistry set that you buy, use once and than it spends a rest of its life on a shelf. Our chemistry set will be delivered to your home gradually, as a subscription, 1-2 experiments per week.

Our chemistry sets, which have been created by experienced chemists, will captivate the interest of your child. They demonstrate real science in all of its depth and beauty. We will provide you with scientific support if an experiment does not work out for you or if you have any questions about the experiments.

Together with the chemistry set you get an educational app for your smartphone or tablet that allows you to see how substances behave in reactions using 3D models. The app will also let you find out more about the topic of the experiment and to answer questions relating to the topic.

MEL Chemistry is the first chemistry set that actually teaches you chemistry rather than just showing you tricks with a scientific slant.

## How it all began
We came together because we are scientific geeks. Almost everyone on our small team became seriously addicted to science starting in childhood. Some got hooked on chemistry, and others on mathematics and physics. If you add up our results in scientific Olympiads, then together we:

* twice took first diploma in city Olympiads in chemistry and four times took diplomas at national competitions in chemistry,
* twice took first diploma in city Olympiads in physics and once at the All-Russian Olympiad in physics,
* in mathematics we took only second place,
* yet we also took first diploma in the country in programming.

After that we did different things. One of us remained in science and founded the most popular scientific tournament in Russia. Others on our team have developed such games as FIFA Street and FIFA 12, recreated the first manned flight into space using 3D-models and founded his own 3D design studio, and founded two mobile software development companies, which have grown to a hundred people each.

When we started to raise our children, we realized that the existing level of education did not suit us. We wanted to give our children more. And here we are together led on by one common idea: how to make  transfering of scientific knowledge easier, more interesting and effective.

## What we are doing

By subscribing to MEL Chemistry, you will receive a new chemistry set every week by post. Each weekly chemistry set contains two-three interesting experiments that your children can do on the weekend. I don't know about you, but we are very worried about our children. They often spend more time with computer games than science. And we are trying to do everything to make science as interesting as possible.

Many people are afraid of chemistry. We have done everything possible to make our experiments as safe as possible. There are no explosions. No harmful substances whatsoever. First we thought that this approach would limit us too much. And do you know what? We have found and designed hundreds of really cool experiments that are absolutely safe.

However, we don't just create interesting experiments. We make sure that you will understand what was happening in each experiment. We reveal how nature is structured from the inside out.

Check the difference. Here is a neat experiment involving the combustion of hydrogen bubbles:

It's a cool experiment, right? Yes. Will your children learn anything from it? No.

However, if together with this pretty experiment we show what is happening on inside on a molecule level level of understanding will be completelly different.

Your child will receive not only a chemistry set. We are also developing a mobile app that shows the structural formula and 3D-models of molecules and explains how the reaction occurs. Thus, software developmentis is as important to us as chemistry set manufacturing. What we do is providing you with a sort of virtual microscope that lets you use your smartphone or tablet to look inside matter and understand how everything is structured.

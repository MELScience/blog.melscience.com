In St Timothy’s they have been using the experiments one between two students in their grade 8 class. They have found that when students are working together without much teacher interference, it has promoted independent thought and cooperation between the students, and increased knowledge retention.

<sub>The students were amazed at the reactions they were able to achieve.</sub>

As St Timothy’s do not have access to a designated science lab, the MEL Chemistry experiments and starting lab kit have allowed them to access hands on experiments in a way that would have been impossible otherwise.

<sub>The hands on nature of the experiments help to increase concentration.</sub>

The middle school science teacher at St Timothy’s said “I am very happy with the MEL Science experiments.The students enjoy the hands-on activities and are learning about chemistry in a fun and entertaining way.”

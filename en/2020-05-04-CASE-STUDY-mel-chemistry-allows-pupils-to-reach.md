The Empower Learning Center is the Alternative Learning Program (ALP) within the Hinckley-Finlayson School District. They offer non-traditional education options for students ages 16-21 in their daytime program, night school for traditional high school students who need to make up credits, and night school for adults 18 and older who would like to complete their diploma or equivalency.
 
The school was seeking engaging, hands-on chemistry kits to make their science classes more interactive, and to help their students understand key science concepts and achieve their full potential in chemistry.

Mrs. Alyssa Prater, Lead Advisor at Empower Learning Center, says, 
 
“Our students like that the MEL Chemistry experiments have everything (or almost everything) included. They are easy to set up and conduct, they are entertaining and educational!”

MEL Science chemistry kits come with a Starter Kit, which includes all the equipment needed to conduct the experiments. The kits contain enough reagents to conduct each experiment at least twice.
 
As an education company, we’re thrilled that we could help inspire these students with science!

We are finally ready to tell what our first product will look like. It will be a chemistry experimental set you can use at home but not a traditional chemistry set. Read what three problems we see in the existing chemistry sets and how we will fix them in our set. You can also subscribe to be notified when the product is released.

## Why chemistry

Chemistry is fun. Chemistry is visual. You can touch it, you can see it, you can smell it. And there is a lot of science in chemistry. If you dig dipper it could be a good introduction to many physics topics like quantum physics, optics, thermodynamics, and many others. It makes chemistry a perfect subject for children to start with science.

## Three problems of the existing chemistry sets

We dream about a product that will be interesting for children and will explain science in a good way. The existing chemistry sets have three problems:

1. You buy it in a store, use once, and then store on a shelf for the next decade
2. They are games: they are fun but do not teach much; children do not understand science behind the experiments
3. They are very old-school: they are not interactive, there is no way to check your progress, they do not motivate much 

## What we are doing

What we do is not a "big box" but a subscription service. By subscribing to MEL Chemistry, you will receive a new chemistry set every week by post. Each weekly chemistry set contains 1-3 interesting experiments that your children can do on the weekend. A typical weekly box content looks like that:

I don’t know about you, but we are personally concerned about the educational progress of our children. They often spend more time on computer games than science and math, so we are trying to do everything we can to make science as interesting and appealing as possible.

Many people are afraid of chemistry, particularly what certain reactions can cause, but we have done everything possible to make our experiments extremely safe. There will be no explosions and no harmful substances of any kind. We initially thought that this overly careful approach would limit us too much, but in fact, we have found and designed hundreds of really cool experiments that are completely safe.

However, we don’t just create interesting experiments; we also make sure that you thoroughly understand what happens in each experiment. We reveal how nature is structured from the inside out, opening up a world of curiosity and wonderment for your child.

Your child will not only be receiving a chemistry set. We are also developing a mobile app that shows the structural formula and 3D models of molecules and effectively explains how the reaction occurs on a visual and accessible scale. What we do is essentially provide you with a virtual microscope that lets you use your smartphone or tablet to look inside physical matter and understand another fascinating side to the world all around us. From my point of view it is the biggest thing, a way to understand real science behind the chemical tricks.

## Price

Each weekly experimental set costs just $10 and this price includes shipment.

## How to subscribe

MEL Chemistry is not ready yet. However, it will be ready soon. You can leave a preorder request and we will contact you as soon as it is ready.

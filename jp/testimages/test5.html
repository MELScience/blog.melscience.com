When light <img src="light.png"> hits an iron ion Fe<sup>3+</sup>&nbsp;<img src="fe3.png"> 
from ammonium iron(III) citrate, it initiates a reaction in which Fe<sup>3+</sup>&nbsp;<img src="fe3.png"> 
gains an electron&nbsp;<img src="electron.png" class="s0">, turning 
(or, as chemists say, reducing) into Fe<sup>2+</sup>&nbsp;<img src="fe2.png">. 
But the product of this reaction is not yet visible, and that's where
potassium hexacyanoferrate(III)&nbsp;<img src="ph3.png">
comes into play. It does not stick to Fe<sup>3+</sup>&nbsp;<img src="fe3.png">, but 
once it meets Fe<sup>2+</sup>&nbsp;<img src="fe2.png">, it forms an insoluble 
intensely-colored compound  <img src="fe2ph3.png"> called Prussian blue. 
This is what we see when we look at a cyanotype image.

Nowadays, this process is used mostly by hobbyists to print photos or even decorate clothes. But in the second half of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it was used much more widely for copying technical drawings. That's why architectural plans and technical drawings are still often called blueprints.

The cyanotype process is not the only way to obtain Prussian blue. In fact, this stunningly blue compound was known as one of the best blue pigments well before cyanotype was invented. Many works of art owe it their striking shades of blue-Hokusai's "Great Wave", which we have just made a print of, for one.
